# Hikari Configuration

Hikari deals with creating and managing DNS records of all deployed applications and databases

All application DNS records point to the IPv4 addresses of Enrai âš¡ instances which in turn reverse-proxies the request to the desired application's IPv4 address and port

All database DNS records point to the IPv4 address of the node where the database's server is deployed

!!!info
    **Hikari ðŸ’¡** automatically creates a DNS entry for **Kaze ðŸŒª** (if deployed) pointing to an **Enrai âš¡** instance which will be further load-balanced among all available **Kaze ðŸŒª** instances

The following section deals with the configuration of Hikari

```toml
############################
#   Hikari Configuration   #
############################

[services.hikari]
# Time Interval (in seconds) in which `Hikari` updates its
# `DNS Record Storage` by polling the central registry-server.
record_update_interval = 15
deploy = false  # Deploy Hikari?
port = 53
```

!!!tip
    You can reduce the value of **record_update_interval** parameter in the above configuration if you need changes in your ecosystem to propagate faster but this will in turn increase the load on the Redis central registry server so *choose wisely*

!!!warning
    **Hikari** usually runs on port 53, hence the Gasper binary must be executed with **root** privileges in Linux systems
