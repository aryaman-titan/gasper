## Overview

Imagine you have a couple of *Bare Metal Servers* and/or *Virtual Machines* (collectively called nodes) at your disposal. Now you want to deploy a couple of applications/services to these nodes in such a manner so as to not put too much load on a single node.<br>

Your 1st option is to manually decide which application goes to which node, then use ssh/telnet to manually
setup all of your applications in each node one by one.<br>

But you are smarter than that, hence you go for the 2nd option which is Kubernetes. You setup Kubernetes in all of your
nodes which forms a cluster, and now you can deploy your applications without worrying about load distribution. But
Kubernetes requires a lot of configuration for each application(deployments, services, stateful-sets etc) not to mention
pipelines for creating the corresponding docker image.<br>

Here comes (ü•Ådrumroll please ü•Å) **Gasper**, your 3rd option!<br>
Gasper builds and runs applications in docker containers **directly from source code** instead of docker images.
It requires minimal parameters for deploying an application, so minimal that you can count them on fingers in one hand ü§ö. Same goes for Gasper provisioned databases. Gone are the days of hard labour (writing configurations).

## Features

Fear not because the reduction in complexity doesn't imply the reduction in features. You can rest assured because
Gasper has:-

* Worker services for creating/managing databases and applications
* Master service for:-
    * Checking the status of worker services
    * Intelligently distributing applications/databases among them
    * Transferring applications from one worker node to another in case of node failure
    * Removing dead worker nodes from the cloud
* REST APIs for master and worker services 
* Reverse-proxy service with HTTPS, HTTP/2 and Websocket support for creating bridge connections to an application
* DNS service which automatically creates DNS entries for all applications which in turn are resolved inside containers
* SSH service for providing ssh access directly to an application's docker container
* Dynamic addition/deletion of nodes and services without configuration changes or restarts
* All of the above packaged with ‚ù§Ô∏è in a **single binary**

## Supported Languages

Gasper currently supports applications of the following types:-

* Static web pages
* PHP
* Python 2
* Python 3
* Node.js
* Golang

It ain't much but it's honest work ü•≥

## Supported Databases

The following databases are supported by Gasper:-

* MySQL
* MongoDB

It ain't.... (complete the rest yourself)
